# Project Vector

## 1. Introduction

In this project, we developed the list *Abstract Data Type (ADT)*. We focus on two aspects of the list: the core operations that should be supported, and the two different forms of organizing the data inside a list, using arrays(static or dynamic) or linked list (singly or doubly linked).

## 2. The classes

The classes we've created are:

**- Vector:**
  
**- MyIterator:**
