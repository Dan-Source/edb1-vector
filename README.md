## 1. Introduction

In this project, we developed the list *Abstract Data Type (ADT)*. We focus on two aspects of the list: the core operations that should be supported, and the two different forms of organizing the data inside a list, using arrays(static or dynamic) or linked list (singly or doubly linked).

## 2. Compiling

To compile this project you must have installed [CMake](cmake.org) on your machine, with all setted up, just run `make` to configure and build the `run_drive` binary file.

> You may use your own `driver.cpp` file, using our vector as you want.
## 3. Using

You may use the [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) documentation to verify the methods and its uses.

## 4. Authorship
