## 1. Introduction

In this project, we developed the list *Abstract Data Type (ADT)*. We focus on two aspects of the list: the core operations that should be supported, and the two different forms of organizing the data inside a list, using arrays(static or dynamic) or linked list (singly or doubly linked).

## 2. Compiling

For compile this project you must have installed [CMake](cmake.org) on your machine and the [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest), with all setted up, just run `make` for configure and build the `run_tests` binary file.

> The GTest will execute _31 tests_ projected by Tchr. Selan Rodrigues, testing many ways to use the vector and its classes.

## 3. Using

You may use the [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) documentation for verify the methods and its uses.
